Personal assistants are made to make our lives convenient. 
I have search around but I have not found any personal assistants that are made to help make a hackers life easier, so I wrote my own. I took the code that was used for my personal assistant and adapted it for hacking. This AI is dedicated to hackers, made for hackers. This program is capable of responding to basic commands such as "Open a reverse shell generator." Upon receiving that input the program will open up revshells.com. This code is limited as to what it will open up though. I have designed it to only feature certain tools that would be needed to perform certain functions in hacking, if you wish to have this code do more please submit an issue to me and I will look into adding that into the code.

Functionality:
As I previously stated the commands this assitant will follow are somewhat limited and must be added in. The current commands are:

The OSINT and Twint functions are still being worked on. 

Open Youtube

Open email

Open github

Open Hackerone

Open you.com (You.com is a search engine with an AI feature integrated that I find very useful for programming and generally searching the web. Yes I know that all search engines are useful but this one is much more helpful in that you can organize preferences of what you wish to see and even have the AI built in write you some code or directly answer your questions.)

Open breach news, Open CVE news, Open exploit news (This commands opens sources that provide you with the latest hacking news, breaches, and CVEs so you can stay up to date with what is goign on. It will open up thehackernews, threatpost, exploit-db, and portswiggers daily swig.)

Open aircraft tracker (Opens up flightradar24 to track aircraft for OSINT investigations.)

Open marine traffic tracker (Opens up marinetraffic.com so you can track watercraft in OSINT investigations.)

Open threat map (Open up threat maps from checkpoint and radware.)

Open webcam (Opens up insecam.org which supposed to be the world's largest database of open webcams. There could be some sketchy stuff that pops up from the feeds but I am not responsible for that. I added this in to view cameras to help in OSINT investigations.)

Open shodan (Shodan is the search engine of the internet of things. An incredibly useful tool for finding exposed devices on the internet.)

Open reverse shell generator (This opens up a reverse shell generator called revshells.com a very helpful website for pentesting and one every hacker should know about.)

(THIS MODEL WILL ALWAYS HAVE MORE FEATURES ADDED AS REQUESTED IN ISSUES BY GITHUB USERS OR FROM STUFF ADDED BY ME. THIS IS GOING TO BE A GROWING PROJECT. IT HAS LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY NOW BUT MORE WILL COME SOON. MY EVENTUAL GOAL IS TO HAVE THIS DO MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE BASIC TASKS NEEDED FOR HACKING. TWINT IS GOING TO BE ADDED IN ONE OF THESE DAYS.)
